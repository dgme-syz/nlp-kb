_DESCRIPTION = """\
TACRED is a large-scale relation extraction dataset with 106,264 examples built over newswire
 and web text from the corpus used in the yearly TAC Knowledge Base Population (TAC KBP) challenges.
 Examples in TACRED cover 41 relation types as used in the TAC KBP challenges (e.g., per:schools_attended
 and org:members) or are labeled as no_relation if no defined relation is held. These examples are created
 by combining available human annotations from the TAC KBP challenges and crowdsourcing.
 Please see our EMNLP paper, or our EMNLP slides for full details.
Note: There is currently a label-corrected version of the TACRED dataset, which you should consider using instead of
the original version released in 2017. For more details on this new version, see the TACRED Revisited paper
published at ACL 2020.
Note 2: This Datasetreader changes the offsets of the following fields, to conform with standard Python usage (see
#_generate_examples()):
- subj_end to subj_end + 1 (make end offset exclusive)
- obj_end to obj_end + 1 (make end offset exclusive)
- stanford_head to stanford_head - 1 (make head offsets 0-based)
